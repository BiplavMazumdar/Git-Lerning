#If we want to create the new branch then follow this steps

#Create Git branch using checkout

The easiest way to create a Git branch is to use the “git checkout” command with the “-b” option for a new branch. Next, you just have to specify the name for the branch you want to create.

git checkout -b <branch-name>

to switch the branch using  git checkout newbranch

#Use the -m flag to change the name of the branch

 # git branch -m new-branch-name
